/// A function that can execute a plugin's [`BackgroundTask`][Plugin::BackgroundTask]s. A plugin can

/// The main plugin trait covering functionality common across most plugin formats. Most formats
/// also have another trait with more specific data and functionality that needs to be implemented
/// before the plugin can be exported to that format. The wrappers will use this to expose the
/// plugin in a particular plugin format.
///
/// NIH-plug is semi-declarative, meaning that most information about a plugin is defined
/// declaratively but it also doesn't shy away from maintaining state when that is the path of least
/// resistance. As such, the definitions on this trait fall in one of the following classes:
///
/// - `Plugin` objects are stateful. During their lifetime the plugin API wrappers will call the
///   various lifecycle methods defined below, with the `initialize()`, `reset()`, and `process()`
///   functions being the most important ones.
/// - Most of the rest of the trait statically describes the plugin. You will find this done in
///   three different ways:
///   - Most of this data, including the supported audio IO layouts, is simple enough that it can be
///     defined through compile-time constants.
///   - Some of the data is queried through a method as doing everything at compile time would
///     impose a lot of restrictions on code structure and meta programming without any real
///     benefits. In those cases the trait defines a method that is queried once and only once,
///     immediately after instantiating the `Plugin` through `Plugin::default()`. Examples of these
///     methods are [`Plugin::params()`], and
///     [`ClapPlugin::remote_controls()`][clap::ClapPlugin::remote_controls()].
///   - Some of the data is defined through associated types. Rust currently sadly does not support
///     default values for associated types, but all of these types can be set to `()` if you wish
///     to ignore them. Examples of these types are [`Plugin::SysExMessage`] and
///     [`Plugin::BackgroundTask`].
/// - Finally, there are some functions that return extension structs and handlers, similar to how
///   the `params()` function returns a data structure describing the plugin's parameters. Examples
///   of these are the [`Plugin::editor()`] and [`Plugin::task_executor()`] functions, and they're
///   also called once and only once after the plugin object has been created. This allows the audio
///   thread to have exclusive access to the `Plugin` object, and it makes it easier to compose
///   these extension structs since they're more loosely coupled to a specific `Plugin`
///   implementation.
///
/// The main thing you need to do is define a `[Params]` struct containing all of your parameters.
/// See the trait's documentation for more information on how to do that, or check out the examples.
/// The plugin also needs a `Default` implementation so it can be initialized. Most of the other
/// functionality is optional and comes with default trait method implementations.
